# useState

`useState` is a hook that lets you add a state variable inside a component.

<hr/>

### Type & Parameters

```ts
function useState<T>(initialState: T): UseState<T>;
```

The only parameter is the `initialState`, which as its name suggests, initialize the state value, it can be a intializer callback like `React`.

<br/>

### Returns

`useState` returns a [UseState](/docs/types#statearray) object, which is an array of three values:

1. `value` : The current state, which will take the value of `initialState` during the first render.
2. `setter`: a function that lets you update the state which will trigger a re-render, accepts a callback with the current state as the argument.
3. `getter` : a function that returns the current value of the state. useful when trying to access the state value within an _asynchronous function_ .

### Notes ⚠️

- useState is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
