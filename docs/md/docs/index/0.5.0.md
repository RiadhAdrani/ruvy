## Pre-Requisite Knowledge

Before diving into our framework, it is essential to have a solid foundation in a few key technologies. Familiarity with JavaScript is crucial, as our framework heavily relies on JavaScript for building interactive web applications. Additionally, having a good understanding of TypeScript will enhance your development experience, as TypeScript provides type-checking and static analysis capabilities.

<br/>

A solid grasp of HTML and CSS is also necessary, as these languages form the backbone of web development. Being comfortable with structuring web pages and styling elements will empower you to create visually appealing and well-structured user interfaces.

<br/>

While not mandatory, some prior experience with other frameworks, particularly React, can be highly beneficial. React has influenced our framework's design and architecture, so having exposure to React's concepts, such as JSX, function components, and hooks, will accelerate your learning and understanding of our framework.

<br/>

With a solid understanding of JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and some exposure to other frameworks like React, you will be well-equipped to leverage the full potential of our framework and unlock a world of creative possibilities in building modern web applications.
