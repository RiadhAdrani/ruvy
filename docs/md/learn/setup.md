# Setup a new Project

Unlike `React`, `Ruvy` is a framework, so it is recommended to build your whole app using it, we suggest a few methods to create your project:

---

## `CLI`

You can create a new starter template using our cli <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RiadhAdrani/create-ruvy">`create-ruvy`</a>:

<br/>

`npm`

```bash
npx @riadh-adrani/create-ruvy
```

`yarn`

```bash
yarn create @riadh-adrani/ruvy
```

---

## `StackBlitz`

If you want to quickly try `Ruvy`, we offer a starter sandbox on `StackBlitz` that you can check out <a target="_blank" href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/ruvy?file=src%2Fmain.tsx">here</a>.
