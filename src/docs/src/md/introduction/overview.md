## What is Ruvy ?

<br/>

Ruvy is another Javascript framework for building user interfaces. It is an experiment to try and understand how `React` works under the hood, and as you may expect, it borrows many concepts and features like `Components`, `JSX` ,`Hooks` ...

<br/>

As of now, `Ruvy` is built with only `Single-Page Application (SPA)` in mind, it offers a `Router` and a key-value `Store` which is available globally.
