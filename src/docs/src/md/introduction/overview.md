## What is Ruvy ?

<br/>

It is a revolutionary new front-end framework, designed for beginners and those who want to learn the ins and outs of building modern web applications. Inspired by the popular React library, this framework incorporates many of the same features such as JSX, function components, and hooks, but with a unique twist - it is entirely synchronous!

<br/>

What does that mean for you as a learner? It means you can focus on mastering the core concepts of front-end development without getting bogged down in the complexities of asynchronous programming. With a simplified approach to state management and rendering, this framework offers a streamlined and intuitive workflow that will have you building beautiful and functional web applications in no time.

<br/>

And don't worry, even though this framework is not intended for production use, the skills you learn while working with it will translate seamlessly to real-world development projects. So whether you're a beginner just starting out or an experienced developer looking to expand your skillset, this framework is the perfect tool to take your front-end development skills to the next level.

<br/>

As of now, `Ruvy` is built with only `Single-Page Application (SPA)` in mind, it offers a `Router` and a key-value `Store` which is available globally.
