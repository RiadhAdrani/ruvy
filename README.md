# Ruvy

Ruvy is a lightweight front-end framework inspired by the principles of React, designed specifically for learning purposes. It incorporates familiar concepts such as JSX, function components, and hooks, providing a simplified and synchronous approach to building web applications.

## Features

- JSX syntax for writing expressive and reusable UI components.
- Function components for a modular and composable code structure.
- Hooks for managing state, performing side effects, and custom logic reuse.
- Synchronous rendering for a straightforward and beginner-friendly development experience.
- Intuitive API that closely resembles React's patterns and conventions.

## Getting Started

To get started with Ruvy, you can generate a starter template using our `cli` (coming soon).
